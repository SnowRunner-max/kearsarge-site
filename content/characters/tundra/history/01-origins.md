The Maw's Gift: Private Notes of J. Corval.

Tundra Karsvaldr was born in Draumveil Crater Colony, the place miners call The Maw. His father dragged the family there from an agrarian outpost on Kearsarge IV. He wanted to prove himself in the veins, to win something more than dirt and wheat. The governor's office logged their arrival like it logs all arrivals: another family for the machine.

The Maw had no patience for pride. His father died young, marrow collapse before Tundra learned to read. I've seen dozens of such men--bodies emptied, spines bowed, eyes gone gray. But I wonder if the boy remembers his father at all, or if he remembers only absence.

His mother, Elin, lived on. Stronger than she let on. I've reviewed enough witness notes to know she was likely Cat-4, but she hid it. Avoided testing, kept to low-risk duties. People whispered, but whispers die in the Maw faster than men do. She carried the boy as best she could, quiet and steady, as if refusing to be noticed could shield him from the same fate.
