At sixteen, he entered the shafts. It was inevitable; half-grown boys are pressed into full-grown work when quotas loom. Foreman Viklund wrote that he wouldn't last a month. The Maw eats boys like him.

But Tundra thrived. I've read the records a dozen times. He worked shifts that broke older men. Hauled double loads, lungs clear in vapor that sent others to their knees. His coat--pale, faintly blue under Tyrium lamps--earned him the first name the miners gave him: White Maw. At first a joke, then something heavier. A mark.

Even then, there was something uncanny. Vapor bending around him, dust clearing as though the air itself bent to his frame. Miners avoid the strange--they mock it, then they fear it. With him, fear took root quickly.

I tell myself I study these things professionally. That's why I pore over the early notes. But when I picture him at sixteen--already broadening, already different from the others--I find myself lingering too long. My pen drags. I shouldn't.
