By seventeen, the recruiters circled. Solvik wrote his oily little assessments, all "asset" and "dividends," as if Tundra were a number on a ledger. He recommended Rift Facility transfer. I should have felt relief--someone else's responsibility. But when the miners began speaking his name like a prayer, I leaned closer to their words.

White Maw. Not Cat-5, not anomaly. White Maw.

Viklund's reports from the Rift show the truth of it: Tundra worked longer, carried more, grew larger each week. Tools bent in his hands. Frost feathered steel where he braced. Crews followed him into the shafts, convinced his shadow protected them. Others fled his presence, muttering that he "stole their air."

I was assigned his handler then. Officially, I was to catalog rumors, keep a human ledger of what the data couldn't show. Unofficially--I began to watch him. And watching became something else.

He was taller than the Cat-4s, broader through the shoulders. Their strength looked swollen, unbalanced. His looked... natural. Beautiful. I use that word in my own notes, here, where no one will read it. His movements were clean, unhurried. He carried loads that should have left him staggering, and yet he moved with grace.

I began writing lines I deleted from the official files. "Not monstrous--perfected." "Balanced. A weapon disguised as a man." My hand shakes as I admit it, but it wasn't only fascination. It was hunger.
