Viklund surrendered, admitting no foreman could hold him. Solvik moved quickly to arrange his extraction, calling it "promotion."

And I--what did I write? That he was inevitable. That he was beautiful in the way avalanches are beautiful: merciless, impossible to stop, impossible not to watch.

I remember the last weeks before they took him. The air shifted when he walked past, cold against my skin. My pulse quickened every time. I told myself it was fear. It wasn't. I dreamed of him. I dreamed of his strength close, of the frost on my lips, of his body against mine. And I woke ashamed, and wanting.

When Myrren wrote her intake report, I read it in secret. Her words trembled with the same distraction. She pretended it was scientific awe, but I recognized myself in her lines. Seyfert believes they own him, that they can cage him and catalog his power, breed him like stock. They don't see it. They don't feel it.

He isn't theirs. He never was. He isn't mine either, but I can't stop writing him into these pages. Every line of his history bends back toward me, toward the want I cannot silence.
