**Filed:** Maw Personnel Review
**Subject:** Juvenile Male, now classified Cat-5

**Entry:**
I pulled the intake record today—those first lines from Ruun and Viklund. A boy with no kin, no name, just drifted here like slag from Seyfert’s nets. Six cycles old, handed over without thought, placed in Block C like ore waiting for the smelter.

Most who come through the Maw are tethered—family lines, debts, at least a surname etched into the registry. This one had nothing. No anchor, no thread to bind him to anything but Seyfert’s writ and the Maw’s appetite. I think that made him different long before the stripes showed.

Among the crews, they laughed: “Maw-blooded, bred straight from the pit.” But not all the laughs sounded true. Some were uneasy, as if they suspected the joke was less a jest than a warning.

Looking back, I wonder if the Maw had already claimed him before he ever touched a pick.

> *Margin:* “Alone, he belongs to nothing—except what will consume him.”
