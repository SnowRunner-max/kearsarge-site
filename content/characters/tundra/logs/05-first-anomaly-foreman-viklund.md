**Filed:** Maw Colony Labor Registry
**Subject:** Tundra – Shaft Worker, B-shaft rotation

**Entry:**
Shift length: fourteen hours continuous. Subject displayed no fatigue, no respiratory strain, no collapse. Crew reports he worked beyond rotation without pause.
Physique: frame leaner than others, yet strength exceeded load expectations.
Dermal change: pale fur beginning to stripe through with cobalt-blue bands along shoulders and flank.
Environmental anomaly: in shaft conditions, vapor flows inward—drawn into the stripes. Outside shaft, vapor seeps outward, faint mist in his wake.

Crew response: unsettled. No complaint filed, but whispers spreading.

Filed with concern marker.
