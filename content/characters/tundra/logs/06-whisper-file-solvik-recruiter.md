**Filed:** Seyfert Internal Channels
**Subject:** Tundra – Maw Shaft Worker, anomaly under observation

**Entry:**
Preliminary assessment: anomaly is not degradation. Observed dermal stripes act as conduits. Tyrium vapor flows inward under load—strengthening, not weakening. Subject’s stamina exceeds human metrics. No collapse, no crash.

Crew terminology emerging: “White Maw.” Rumor suggests the pit itself feeds him. Miners whisper it in half-fear, half-reverence. Nickname spreading faster than suppression can hold.

Recommendation: escalate classification review. Category-5 suspicion warranted. Subject should not remain in standard shaft rotation—risk of uncontrolled myth-making among crews.

Filed under personal advisement for priority handling.

> *Margin:* “If the Maw would devour him, better Seyfert devour first.”
