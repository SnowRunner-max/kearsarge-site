**Filed:** Seyfert Reclassification Dossier
**Subject:** Tundra – Maw Shaft Worker, alias “White Maw”

**Entry / Recommendation:**
**Classification recommendation:** Category-5.
Age: seventeen cycles. Frame broadening beyond Cat-4 parameters—hypertrophy evident, mass and leverage surpassing shaft norms.
Observed performance: ore-loads moved without team support, collapse points cleared without relay. Stamina appears limitless within shaft environment.

Crew reaction: divided. Some cling to him, loyal beyond reason. Others keep distance, report unease, request reassignment. “White Maw” nickname now common currency. Attempts to suppress usage unsuccessful.

Assessment: subject represents more than labor. He embodies the Maw itself—a living claw carved from Tyrium and hunger. Crews respond to him as they would to a force, not a man.

**Recommendation:** immediate transfer from shaft to Seyfert custody. Continued exposure risks solidifying his myth among miners. Potential for controlled deployment: military, extraction, biopharma.

Filed with urgency for review.
