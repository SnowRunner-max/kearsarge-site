**Filed:** Maw Colony Labor Registry, Rift Assignment
**Subject:** Tundra – Reclassified Cat-5

**Entry:**
Age: eighteen cycles. Stationed to Rift Facility.
Physical condition: rapid alteration beyond recorded parameters. Spinal ridges crystallizing blue, sharp to touch, luminous in dim shaft light. Elbow joints hardening into crystalline protrusions. Mandible lengthened—canines extended into saber fangs, exhaling steady vapor. Claw growth extreme, keratin darkened to obsidian sheen.

Environmental anomaly: frost condenses around him. Air grows brittle in his presence. Tools left in proximity rim with ice.
Behavioral note: refuses issued clothing, accepts only harness and load rig. Carries himself hunched, frame immense, yet when he rises to full height crews fall silent.

Crew response: mixture of terror and fascination. No mutiny reported, but discipline tenuous. Some trail him willingly; others look for any excuse to avoid the Rift rotation.

Filed with unease.
