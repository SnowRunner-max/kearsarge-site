**Filed:** Maw Personnel Supplement
**Subject:** Tundra – Rift Worker, alias “White Maw”

**Entry:**
Compiled from crew chatter and my own observation. Rumors persist that he is not merely surviving the Maw but feeding on it. Men claim the vapor runs into his stripes like breath into lungs. Others say he “eats the cold” itself.

Division among crews grows sharper: some follow his lead in silence, eyes fixed on him as though he were foreman and core both. Others turn away, request transfer, mutter about curses.

Recorded observation: his frame broadens with unnatural symmetry—shoulders ridged with crystal, muscles swelling hard as the stone he tears apart. The blue striping along his hide glows faintly in darkness, vapor tracing patterns across him like breath across frost. His fangs drip mist, his eyes catch every gleam of Tyrium light and hold it until you feel caught yourself. When he moves through the caverns, the air sharpens; tools crack with ice, and yet he burns with impossible vitality.

**Private note:** I met him once in the caverns, against protocol. I told myself it was duty—direct study—but it was not. I had to see him without the crew, had to stand close enough to hear the low growl of vapor in his chest. He looked at me, not as handler or overseer, but as if I were nothing at all—and I have never felt more seen.

Filed for record, though words fail.
