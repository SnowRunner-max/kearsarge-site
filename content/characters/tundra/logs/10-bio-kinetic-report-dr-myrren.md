**Filed:** Seyfert Rift Facility – Research Division
**Subject:** Tundra – Cat-5 anomaly, alias “White Maw”

**Metrics logged across multiple sessions:**
- Skeletal hypertrophy balanced, no sign of strain fractures. Muscle mass doubling within months yet maintaining proportion.
- Reflex tests surpass Cat-5 thresholds—reaction time closer to predictive than responsive.
- Frost bleed measurable at two-meter radius: surface temperature drops, moisture crystallizes in ambient air. Vapor emission constant at rest, intensifies under stress.

**Cognitive:** Cognitive acceleration noted. Pattern recognition trials solved before full data presented. Problem-solving speed erratic but staggering—jumps from silence to insight, bypassing steps entirely.

**Physical profile:** spine crowned with crystalline ridges, glowing faintly in shaft dark. Claws harder than alloy implements; fangs emit vapor steady as breath. Blue striping no longer confined—networks the whole frame, pulsing faintly with Tyrium resonance.

**Personal note (unfiled draft fragment preserved):** He is not monstrous. He is perfected. Others look for corruption or deformity, but I see symmetry, convergence. The Maw has crowned him in crystal and frost, shaped him as its sovereign. Seyfert calls him asset. They do not understand—he is coronation.
