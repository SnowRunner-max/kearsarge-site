**Filed:** Seyfert Security Division
**Subject:** Tundra – Cat-5 anomaly, alias “White Maw”

**Incident Summary:**
Subject repeatedly penetrates restricted tunnels leading toward the Rift Core. Bypassed three mechanical locks and one coded seal. No evidence of forced entry. Recovered each time without resistance, returned to shaft rotation as if nothing occurred.

**Behavioral Note:**
Speaks of the Core as if it summons him. Statements recorded: “It calls,” “I hear it,” “The Maw wants me below.” Subject unresponsive to reprimand. Obeys tasking when observed, but deviates as soon as surveillance relaxes.

**Risk Assessment:**
Subject fixation on Core represents catastrophic hazard. Crew discipline compromised—some follow his lead without order, others refuse duty outright. Containment threshold exceeded.

**Recommendation:**
Escalation to Seyfert command. If subject continues breaching Core access, standard facility security protocol insufficient.
