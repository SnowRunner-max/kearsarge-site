**Filed:** Maw Colony Labor Registry, Rift Facility
**Subject:** Tundra – Cat-5 anomaly

**Entry:**
Crew division worsening. Half follow his lead in silence, the other half beg transfer.
Subject obeys orders when spoken, but continues breaching limits.
Strains ore-haul beyond regulation weight.
Moves through restricted tunnels without clearance. Returns without explanation.
Physical dimensions now beyond crew restraint. Too large, too strong.
Command authority no longer effective. If Seyfert wants him, they can come take him.

Filed under protest.

> *Margin:* “We are done breaking ourselves on him.”
