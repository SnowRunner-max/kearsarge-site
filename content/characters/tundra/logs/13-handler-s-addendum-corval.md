**Entry (personal / confessional):**
The records say he is monstrous: ridges glowing, claws that split stone, fangs forever dripping vapor. But those words are scaffolding, not truth. The truth is what happens when the cavern closes around us and no one is there to watch. Against every regulation, I return to him. I tell myself I go for study, for insight, but the lie grows thinner each time.

When he draws me close, I feel the Tyrium moving in him, and then—impossibly—through me. It is cold and burning, venom and ecstasy both. For a breathless instant I feel perfect, like I belong to the Maw’s will as much as he does. And afterward comes the horror, knowing it is not leaving me.

I hide it as best I can, but I see it: faint streaks of cobalt in my own fur, glowing when the cavern darkens, shimmering just like his. I cover them, I deny them, but they spread.

I know this is corruption. I know I should be afraid. And yet when I feel the Maw inside me, I am glad.
