**Filed:** Seyfert Priority Command
**Subject:** Tundra – alias “White Maw”

**Summary:**
Subject fixation on Core now critical. Multiple breaches of restricted tunnels. Security measures ineffective—locks bypassed without trace. Crew enthrallment documented. Several workers reported missing; survivors exhibit behavioral alteration consistent with fixation on subject.

**Risk Assessment:**
Subject uncontainable within Rift environment. Crew productivity collapsing under division: loyalty, fear, worship. Reports from Handler Corval increasingly compromised—language unprofessional, suggestive of contamination. Recommend removal before further personnel degradation.

**Opportunity Statement:**
Extraction offers immediate research pathways. Subject demonstrates unique Tyrium metabolization; body not degraded but enhanced. Potential military application—shock trooper template. Potential biopharma extraction—augmentative therapies.

**Recommendation:**
Immediate retrieval to orbital facility. Subject to be secured, studied, and if viable, replicated. Delay increases risk of full Maw integration.

Filed urgent.
