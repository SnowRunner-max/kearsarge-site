**Filed:** Seyfert Orbital Facility, Research Division
**Subject:** Tundra – alias “White Maw”

**Entry / Measurements:**
Measurements taken on arrival. Height exceeds projection by 0.3 meters. Mass denser than expected—musculature hypertrophied but balanced. Dermal ridges luminous with Tyrium resonance, claw keratin harder than tested alloys. Fangs extend beyond safe restraint—containment protocols modified.

Ambient effect: temperature within five meters drops to freezing. Surfaces rimmed in frost. Vitals unaffected. Subject inhales vapor in measured rhythm; exhalation forms visible plume.

**Cognitive testing:**
Accelerated beyond Cat-5 baseline. Pattern recognition instantaneous. Displays ability to infer outcomes with minimal data. Refuses standard language trials; answers selectively, often in metaphor. Statements recorded: “I will return to the Maw,” and, “It waits.”

**Research conclusion:**
Seyfert labels this deformity. It is not. It is coronation. Subject is not accident but culmination. The Maw crowned him in frost and crystal, and we stole him from his kingdom. We did not interrupt corruption. We interrupted ascension.
