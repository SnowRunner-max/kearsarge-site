**Filed:** Seyfert Orbital Archive
**Subject:** Tundra – alias stricken

**Public statement:**
A promising miner of Maw Colony has been promoted to special duty in Seyfert service. His record of discipline and endurance exemplifies the strength of Maw stock and the reliability of Seyfert oversight.

Rumors of Tyrium corruption or anomalous alteration are without merit. Such tales are common in the caverns and should be regarded as superstition. Alias “White Maw” has been officially removed from registry; dissemination of such terms will be treated as insubordination.

This record stands as the definitive account. Future generations will see no fractures, no divergence, only the proper ascent of a worker into Seyfert service.

Filed, sealed, and archived.

**Filed:** Not in official registry. Retrieved fragment.
**Subject:** Tundra – my White Maw

**Fragment (confession / plan):**
They have taken him from the Rift, from the cold throne where he belonged. In their hands he is diminished—still vast, still radiant, but caged, trimmed into something obedient. They parade him as weapon, speak of him as asset. The Maw’s beast, Seyfert’s blade.

But I remember what he was in the caverns, when the vapor flowed through us both. I can still feel it, even now. It burns under my skin, traces of cobalt showing in my own fur. I bind them, cover them, but they spread. The Maw is in me. He put it there.

When I see him through the glass, he is no longer the sovereign the Rift crowned. They have shackled his will, broken the terrible majesty that made men vanish and others kneel. He obeys. He answers. He does not look at me as he once did.

Still—I will not leave him to them. I will free him, tear down the walls, return him to the Maw. Back to what he is meant to be. Back to what we are meant to be.

But a fear gnaws at me. What if he does not follow? What if he will not come? I tell myself the Maw’s will is inevitable, that he is mine, but when I close my eyes I see him looking past me, beyond me, back toward the Rift. And in that gaze, I know: if I bring him out, it will not be for me.

Still—I will do it. I have no choice. He is inevitable. And if he will not be mine, then at least he will be the Maw’s again.

> *Margin (smudged, half-erased):* “I love him. Or I love what the Maw made of him. Perhaps there is no difference.”
