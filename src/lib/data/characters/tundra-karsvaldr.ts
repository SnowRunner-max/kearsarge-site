      body:
        "Tundra was born in Draumveil Crater Colony—a place the miners themselves called The Maw, for the way it swallowed lives without pause. His father dragged the family there from a safer agrarian outpost on Kearsarge IV’s temperate belt. Pride drove the decision: he wanted to prove himself in the Tyrium veins, to rise above the endless cycle of wheat, corn, and potatoes. His mother opposed the move, whispering of old superstitions about families marked for ruin by the ore, but her voice was drowned out by her husband’s ambition.\n\nGovernor Alvis Ruun recorded their arrival with a single dry line: “Another eager family chasing fortune. The Maw will sort the worthy from the weak.”\n\nThe gamble failed. His father was nothing more than another Category 2 casualty, bleeding out from marrow collapse before Tundra had learned his letters. Foreman Korr Viklund logged the death with the same indifference he gave to broken tools: “Another one down. Ore takes who it wants. Quota unchanged.”\n\nHis mother—quiet, haunted—hid her own flashes of strength, her Category 4 potential. Despite resistance to Tyrium being a badge of honor, to her it was a curse: a path that ended in separation from her son and a reminder of her husband’s hubris. Handler Jeyna Corval would later write, in a retrospective review: “She stayed small so he could grow.”",

      title: "Childhood in the Maw",
      body:
        "In a colony where half-grown boys were considered full hands, Tundra entered the mines at sixteen. Viklund’s entry in the HR system was grimly brief: “Another boy in the Maw. If he lasts a month, I’ll be surprised.”\n\nBut Tundra was different. Even at that age, he grew broader than the other miners, his pale coat catching the Tyrium lamps with a bluish frost. Viklund’s incident notes shifted from dismissal to unease: “Doesn’t tire, doesn’t stumble. Cart straps barely mark him. Looks carved out of stone. Feels wrong to write him up for being too strong.”\n\nBy seventeen, whispers of his nature spread. Recruiter Daran Solvik, circling like a vulture, filed a “whisper file” for corporate review: “Promising find. If nurtured properly, could yield long-term dividends. If not, the Maw will eat him like the rest. Better Seyfert take the first bite.”\n\nThe miners had already named him. Not “Godborn”—a name too clean for men who lived with dust in their lungs. They called him White Maw. A joke at first, then a warning, then finally something spoken without mockery. To them, he was the proof the crater could spit something back.",
    },

      title: "The Marked Years",
      body:
        "At nineteen, Tundra was reassigned to the First Rift Facility, one of the primary crater mines where Tyrium bled straight from the planetary wounds.\n\nViklund, now Rift overseer, wrote detailed reports with growing dread: “The boy runs longer than he should. Cart loads heavier than three men could shift, and still he doesn’t breathe hard. The air clears around him when he moves. Frost feathers the collars he leans on. Every day he looks less like a worker and more like something the Maw didn’t mean to give us.”\n\nThe miners’ folklore hardened around the name White Maw. Handler Corval compiled their words with a dangerous warmth: “He carries size and presence that doesn’t belong to one so young. Seyfert calls him subject. In truth, he is beautiful, in the way avalanches are beautiful: inevitable, merciless, and impossible not to watch.”\n\nEven the scientists struggled. Dr. Ilsa Myrren’s clinical logs dissolved into awe: “Tyrium does not degrade him. It perfects him. Symmetry balanced, efficient, aesthetically striking. I caution myself to remain clinical—but it is difficult.”",

      title: "The Unmanageable One",
      body:
        "Tundra’s fixation became the Core, the fabled heart of the crater where Tyrium welled pure and alive. To most, the idea of reaching it was suicidal fantasy; to him, it was destiny.\n\nSecurity Chief Malrik Otten logged him as a containment hazard: “He’s not hostile yet. That’s the problem. Hostility we can handle. Belief is harder.”\n\nViklund gave up trying to restrain him: “No chain of command holds. If Seyfert wants him so bad, they can come take him.”\n\nHandler Corval’s own addenda by then were half confession, half desire: “When he passes, the air chills, but I burn hotter for it. I dream of him some nights, and I wake ashamed, knowing Seyfert would never permit it. Still—I can’t look at him without wanting to close the gap.”\n\nSeyfert did take him. Solvik filed the extraction order under the euphemism of “promotion”: “His loss in-field would represent irreparable opportunity cost. Immediate removal required. By the time they notice he’s gone, Seyfert will already own the story, the patents, and the legacy.”\n\nDr. Myrren received him on the orbital facility, her intake record betraying barely restrained hunger: “Not monstrous. Perfected. His body is flawless, balanced, a weapon disguised as a male. Seyfert believes he is under control. They are wrong. Control is a fantasy.”",

His service ensures the continued prosperity and security of all Seyfert colonies.”\n\nEverything else—Viklund’s warnings, Otten’s risk bulletins, Corval’s forbidden desire, Myrren’s trembling awe—was sealed, redacted, buried.\n\nIn the open record, he was a promising miner elevated to “special duty.”\n\nIn the truth of the logs, he was White Maw.

Pulled a thirteen-hour shift today, break barely worth counting. Most men need two rotations in the vapor this thick. He doesn’t. When the rest are doubled over, coughing into the filters, he looks like he’s just got started. \n\nHe’s growing too. Came up from the Maw wiry. Two weeks here and the shirts are tight across his back. Hands big enough now to wrap around a pry bar and snap it—said the steel was flawed, but I’ve swung plenty of those bars myself. \n\nA few things worth recording proper: \n- **Cart load average:** 510–560 kg, peak haul ~590. Solo. \n- **Uniform reissue:** two sizes up since Rift arrival (17 days). \n- **Tool anomaly:** T-grade pry bar bent mid-shaft under pressure. Marked as tool failure but suspect strength factor. \n- **Atmos index:** 1.9 mS/m on monitors, red-band. He works it as if it were green. \n\nStrangest thing, though: the air changes when he moves. Vapor clears around him, just a shimmer, like the dust is pushed off his skin. Crew swears it feels colder in his wake. I thought it was nerves until I saw frost feather a valve collar he leaned on. Melted quick, but it was there. \n\nThe men have started calling him “Godborn.” I told them to cut it out, but words like that stick. Some stick close, want his shadow. Others won’t share a shaft with him. Two fights already—both blamed him for “crowding the air.” Nonsense, but you can’t argue with a miner’s gut. \n\nRecommendation: Acquisition should stop sniffing and make a call. He’s past the point of blending in. I can keep him on Line 3 a little longer, but every day he looks less like a worker and more like something the Maw didn’t mean to give us. \n\nMargin: Thirty years down here, I’ve seen the ore take plenty.

He eats cold. That’s why the ore don\\'t bite him.” \n- \"Saw him lift a cart coupler clean off the track—three men strained and he did it like it was a child’s toy.” \n\nThe nickname White Maw has hardened into common use. No hesitation, no mockery. Even crew chiefs have used it in assignment chatter. \n\nCrew response diverges sharply. Some follow him like a living talisman, volunteering to work his shafts because “he takes the bad luck with him.” Others refuse proximity altogether, claiming they taste metal on their tongues when he’s near. \n\n*Personal Note (restricted): Among miners he stands apart, but not only for what he does. Even beside confirmed Cat-4, he outpaces them in frame, in bearing. Broader through the shoulders, taller now than most, and still growing. The pale of his coat under the Tyrium lamps makes him look carved from stone, cold-fire veins lit beneath. I’ve watched crews quiet when he enters a line, as if the shift itself bends to make room for him. And I admit—I quiet too. He carries size and presence that doesn’t belong to one so young. Seyfert calls him asset, subject, Cat-5. But in truth, he is beautiful, in the way avalanches are beautiful: inevitable, merciless, and impossible not to watch.*\n\nRecommendation: Maintain catalog of alias “White Maw.” Permit its spread; attempting to erase it will elevate it further.",

Minor frost deposition recorded, rapid dissipation. \n\n**Cognitive assessment:**\n- Pattern recognition accelerated: 96% success rate on lattice progression test, highest in current Rift cohort. \n- Short-term retention of numeric sequences (40+ digits) intact over 72h without decline. \n\n**Researcher Notes (restricted):** Subject diverges sharply from Cat-5 mean. Tyrium exposure does not degrade cellular function but appears to induce structural reinforcement. Muscular architecture suggests adaptive hypertrophy rather than degeneration. Unclear if we are observing unique mutation or a new subclass of Cat-5 altogether. \n\nPersonal aside (not for circulation): He does not present as monstrous. He presents as perfected.

I’ve denied him Core-side pulls three times this week; he goes anyway. Says nothing, just walks down into the red like the signs aren’t there. Crews follow him half the time. The other half they won’t even share a shaft with him. \n\nWe’re past the point of “managing” him. No chain of command holds. He listens, nods, then keeps moving. Can’t write him up—who’d enforce it?

Taller, broader, balanced in a way the others never are. Their strength looks forced, distorted by strain. His looks natural—frighteningly so. The way he carries a cart or braces a collar, it isn’t just power. It’s grace. \n\nI won’t hide it: there’s pull there. When he passes, the air chills, but I burn hotter for it. I dream of him some nights, and I wake ashamed, knowing Seyfert would never permit it. Cat-5 bodies belong to the company, their blood harvested and matched for breeding like stock. And still—I can’t look at him without wanting to close the gap. \n\nThe men call him White Maw because they think the Rift spat him out. I think it shaped him on purpose.

        "### [LOG 14: INTAKE RECORD – ORBITAL FACILITY TALLON]\n*Filed by:* Dr. Ilsa Myrren, Seyfert Bio-Kinetics Division\n*Date:* [REDACTED]\n*Classification:* Strategic Priority \n\nSubject: Karsvaldr, Tundra. Alias: White Maw. Cat-5. \n**Initial Measurements:**\n- Height: 2.04 m (increase +6.3 cm since Rift records). \n- Mass: 143 kg (lean, hypertrophic). \n- Resting pulse: 42 bpm, stable. \n- Surface temperature differential: -1.7 °C vs. baseline human. \n- Notable anomaly: dermal luminescence at exertion thresholds. \n\n**Cognitive Readings:**\n- Memory lattice: 98% retention across 72h. \n- Problem-solving latency: ~40% faster than Cat-5 cohort mean. \n- Displays emergent abstraction: responds to scenario prompts with intuitive leaps rather than linear logic. \n\nResearcher Notes (restricted): His body is… flawless. Not misshapen or twisted, but sculpted, as if Tyrium shaped him with purpose. Strength evident in every movement, yet balanced, poised, a weapon disguised as a male. His presence alters the air of the chamber. I write this clinically, and yet—my hands tremble. \n\nThe cryo-kinetic traces are stronger here than reported. Objects retain frost where he touches them; instruments seize, fail, as though they shiver in his grip. He has not lashed out, not once, but the power is there, sleeping under the skin. Waiting. \n\nPersonal Aside (unauthorized): Seyfert believes he is under control. They are wrong. Control is a fantasy. His growth will not stop in these halls—it will devour them. I will see to it. Even now, as I catalogue his physiology, I want more than knowledge. I want to see how far his strength will climb, how cold the air can fall when he finally decides to open himself. The scientist in me whispers of patents and protocols. The woman in me wants to press closer, to feel the frost bite. \n\nRecommendation: Intensive observation, escalation of protocols. In truth: we are not studying a subject. We are standing in the presence of the weapon that will unravel AURORA itself.",

        "### [LOG 15: PUBLIC RECORD – STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION RELEASE]\n*Filed by:* Archivist Leira Veyl, Seyfert Historical Division \n*Date:* [REDACTED] \n\nSubject: Karsvaldr, Tundra. \n\nSummary for Distribution: Tundra Karsvaldr distinguished himself early in life through discipline, loyalty, and an unshakable commitment to the work of Draumveil Crater Colony. Recognizing his exceptional fortitude, Seyfert Industries elevated him from local labor to special duty in the Rift Program. His transfer represents the highest standard of opportunity afforded to our most promising assets. \n\nOfficial Statement: \n\n“From miner’s son to Seyfert’s chosen—Tundra embodies the triumph of perseverance and the boundless potential of human advancement. His service ensures the continued prosperity and security of all Seyfert colonies.” \n\nNotes: Alias “White Maw” has been stricken from formal record. Circulation restricted. All associated documents folded into Level-7 archive [REDACTED]. Only approved narrative to be disseminated: loyal worker, promoted to special duty. \n\nMargin: Future readers will find no fractures in this story. They will know him only as a symbol of Seyfert’s vision. The rest—the fractures, the obsessions, the failures to contain—will stay sealed.",
