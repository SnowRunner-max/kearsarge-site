        content: `Tundra's body is a marvel of biomechanical engineering. His musculature is enhanced by Tyrium, a bioweapon-grade element that grants him cryokinetic abilities. The Tyrium courses through his veins, visible as faint glowing stripes. It responds to his emotional state, surging during combat or intense physical exertion. It is a symbiotic relationship; the Tyrium enables his physical and cryokinetic abilities, and he feeds it with his adrenaline, aggression, and lust.`,

        title: 'Core Strength',
        content: `Tundra's strength is a product of both intense physical training, powerful mental conditioning, and the Tyrium within his veins. Without Tyrium activation, Tundra's strength is at the peak of human capability. As Tyrium surges through his veins, Tundra's strength and stamina increases rapidly. A Tyrium Surge requires using his Tyrium reserves, but the sudden elevation in power is often worth the cost.`,

        content: `During a Tyrium Surge, Tundra's muscles become more vascular, the veins becoming more visible beneath his fur, and they take on a blue glow.The muscles swell with every pump of blood in his veins. It is an exhilirating and arousing experience--physically, mentally, and sexually. A Tyrium Surge can be triggered by intense physical exertion, combat, or sexual arousal. A Tyrium Surge may last minutes to hours, depending on the amount of Tyrium in his system and the duration of and requirements of the activity. Tundra cannot self-activate a Tyrium Surge; Tyrium Surges are involuntary.`,

        content: `Tundra is a tall, muscular malamute with a powerful build. His build is most analagous to a highly trained firefighter or Crossfit Athlete, with a naturally low body fat percentage. He has a lean, muscular frame with a well-defined chest, arms, and legs. Tyrium has enhanced his naturally gifted frame, along with science, into a uniquely powerful physical form. In his base state, Tundra's naturally vascular, especially on the biceps, shoulders, abdominals, and inner thighs. During a Tyrium Surge, he becomes more vascular and muscle size and density increases.`,

        title: 'Muscle Growth',
        content: `During a Tyrium Surge or when Tundra evolves into a new level of physical strength--fueld by Tyrium--muscles grow slowly, but inexorably in size, densite, and power. The individual muscle fibers flex and grow, bulging beneath the pelt, fighting for prominence. He must struggle to keep control of the process, as if the muscles want to erupt through his skin. It is both deeply satisfying, a little painful, and deeply pleasurable. He lives for these moments and craves them.`,
