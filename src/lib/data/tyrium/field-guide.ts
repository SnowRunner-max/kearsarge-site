## Overview
Tyrium is a family of anomalous states arising from a single exotic substrate recovered from deep planetary strata. It behaves simultaneously as mineral, energetic field, and a bio-corruptive vector. Tyrium interacts with entropy and informational gradients, producing ordered micro-regions that biological and mechanical systems can channel — at a cost. Manifestations are context-dependent: environment, method of extraction, and host biology produce distinct forms and effects.

## Summary of Forms (at-a-glance)
**Raw Vein Tyrium** — in-situ crystalline ore. Stable in rock; hazardous when mined.

**Refined Tyrium** — processed fragments/friction-polished shards used in Aurora tech. Volatile.

**Liquid Tyrium** — a viscous, luminescent fluid phase; chemically and psychically active. *(NEW)*

**Vaporized Tyrium** — aerosolized, highly bioavailable; the most infectious non-contact state.

**Infused Tyrium (Biological State)** — Tyrium integrated into living tissue, forming conduits and signatures.

---

## 1. Raw Vein Tyrium
**Appearance:** Jagged lattice, blue-white luminescence; faint harmonic drift visible under spectroscopy.

**Behavior:** Emits low-frequency resonance when mechanically stressed.

**Stability & Handling:** Usually safe while embedded; destabilizes when sonically or thermally shocked. Standard mining protocols apply (see Containment).

**Field Note:** Vein geometry often predicts local "cold spots" and fauna anomalies.

---

## 2. Refined Tyrium
**Appearance:** Clear, faceted fragments; can be cut into lenses, rods, or pellets.

**Behavior:** Concentrated resonance; amplifies electromagnetic coupling and can be used as compact energy stores in Aurora devices.

**Hazards:** Short exposures cause sensory distortion and mild autonomic collapse in unprotected subjects.

**Application:** Experimental field batteries and conduit cores.

---

## 3. Liquid Tyrium
**Appearance:** Viscous fluid, color range from deep sapphire to milky opal depending on impurity load. Surface emits slow, concentric ripples of light.

**Generation:** Observed where refined Tyrium undergoes rapid pressure/temperature volatility (reactor breaches, high-energy milling) or when vein ore is melted under exotic catalysts. Also produced intentionally in clandestine labs for infusion protocols.

**Behavior:** Forms menisci that resist typical surface tension models, with droplets able to roll uphill on ferromagnetic surfaces when under resonance, while simultaneously interfacing with aqueous and lipid tissues to increase uptake efficiency for biological infusion. Its evaporative profile produces the same vapor species as Vaporized Tyrium but at a controllable rate.

**Biological Effect:** Liquid phase penetrates exposed dermis and mucosa rapidly, seeding infusion patterns that map to vascular and nervous structures. On contact, a "bloom" of bio-illumination often appears within hours.

**Containment:** Requires both chemical neutralizers (see Appendix — Tyrium Solvents) and field dampeners. Liquid pools generate local psychotropic halos and are major vectors for group contagion — extreme quarantine.

**Field Use / Abuse:** Weaponized as a dispersal medium (clandestine dosing), or used in surgical "bonding" procedures by fringe groups seeking predictable infusion patterns.

**Note:** Liquid Tyrium can be stabilized into gels for transport but such gels can re-liquefy under electromagnetic excitation.

---

## 4. Vaporized Tyrium
**Appearance:** Thin, shimmering azure mist; invisible on IR but detectable on subsonic scanners.

**Behavior:** Most efficient non-contact pathway for biological resonance seeding. Aerosols strongly bind to cationic proteins in lung tissue.

**Hazards:** Rapid onset of metabolic alteration; inhalation exposure is escalation pathway to infusion in under 48 hours.

---

## 5. Infused Tyrium (Biological State)
**Appearance:** Patterned bioluminescence—stripes, veins, or sigils—along integument, often following neural/vascular maps.

**Functional Effect:** Host becomes a resonant conduit capable of channeling Tyrium’s order into directed manifestations (referred to as **kinetics**). Expression varies widely by host, infusion pattern, and origin of Tyrium exposure.

**Psychological / Social Effect:** Escalating obsession, territorial fixation, and social contagion. Infused groups can form emergent hierarchies around "resource" sites.

---

## KINETICS — Types, Origins, and Expressions
*Important framing:* “Kinetics” refers to the host’s capacity to manipulate a physical parameter of their environment via Tyrium-mediated resonant coupling. Kinetics is **not** a single power; it is a family of possible manipulations whose form depends on origin, infusion topology, and host physiology.

### A. Origins & Correlations
**Maw-Origin Tyrium.** Historically associated with the Maw phenomenon and Maw-affected hosts, most commonly yielding **cryo-kinetic** manifestations such as local suppression of particle motion, frost generation, and moisture solidification. Hosts often show patterned banding along limbs and torso and a strong compulsion to return to Tyrium sources.

**Colony/Industrial-Origin Tyrium.** Tyrium processed or adulterated by industrial reagents, or implanted via Aurora tech, tends to produce **variant kinetics**—including pyrolytic bursts, electromagnetic surges, or directed pressure fields—and these manifestations are often less stable and more sensitive to damping fields.

**Aleatory/Natural Variation.** Some low-level Tyrium occurrences (trace, mixed-mineral veins) have produced **gravitic modulation**, **telekinetic displacement**, or **psionic-affiliated** sensory enhancements. These are rare but documented.

### B. Common Kinetic Families
**Cryo-Kinesis.** Local entropy suppression resulting in ice formation and reduced thermal agitation, with Maw-aligned hosts most associated with this expression.

**Pyro-Kinesis.** Focused exothermic bursts, ignition of combustibles, and localized temperature spikes, frequently linked to industrial or refined origins.

**Electro-Kinesis.** Generation and shaping of electrical fields, enabling EMP-style disruption or directed arcs.

**Gravitic/Pressure Kinesis.** Modulation of local force vectors to push or pull objects and form micro-gravity wells.

**Telekinetic/Vector Kinesis.** Direct manipulation of macroscopic objects without clear intermediary fields, manifesting as precise and often surgical force application.

**Psionic-Affine Sensory Kinesis.** Enhanced perceptual acuity, low-bandwidth empathic resonance, and in some cases rudimentary group-synchronization.

**Hybrid Expressions.** Many hosts display composites (for example, cryo with pressure) depending on infusion topology.

### C. Expression Patterns
**Conduit Topology Matters.** Stripes along muscle groups favor force and strength amplification, branching patterns along neural maps favor perceptual or motor-precision kinetics, and dense focal nodules produce high-energy bursts at great physiological cost.

**Dose and Distribution.** Sparse, distributed infusion tends to yield subtle, controllable kinetics, while heavy, focal infusion delivers raw power and rapid psychological corruption.

**Behavioral Triggers.** Emotional arousal—fear, rage, lust—acts as an amplifier, and stress or pain often unlocks latent kinetic outputs.

### D. Examples (Case Briefs)
**Subject Tundra (Maw-Influenced).** Primary expression manifests as cryo-kinetics with muscular hypertrophy. Clear stripe-pattern infusion across flanks correlates with limb-focused channeling and a frost aura. Behavioral profile trends defensive, isolative, and periodically violent under provocation.

**Subject Corval (Industrial Infusion).** Exhibits mixed kinetic output: brief electromagnetic pulses followed by focused telekinetic micro-manipulation. Infusion pattern features nodal implants along the cervical spine, with an obsessive, strategic behavioral profile driven by a desire to "free" Maw-affected subjects.

---

## Interactions (Expanded)
**Environmental:** Tyrium subsets alter local fluid dynamics, sound propagation, and electromagnetic baseline, while liquid pools create standing wave patterns that attract small fauna.

**Biological:** Binds to genomic regulatory motifs and can rewrite protein expression related to muscle, nerve conduction, and hormone regulation, with liquid and vapor phases accelerating the process.

**Mechanical:** Causes unpredictable resonance with machine parts—bearings seize, capacitors collapse, sensors return false positives—and refined Tyrium used as an energy conduit can catastrophically amplify transient inputs.

**Social/Psychic:** Group exposure fosters synchronized fixation, and in extreme cases hosts coordinate to guard Tyrium sources as if under shared compulsion.

## Effects by Exposure Level (Updated)
| **Exposure** | **Duration** | **Observed Effect** |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Trace dust   | Minutes      | Mild vertigo, tingling; short-term sensory sharpening |
| Low vapor    | Hours        | Dermal luminescence, chills, minor compulsions |
| Liquid touch | Minutes–Hours| Rapid dermal uptake; localized infusion patterning; euphoria → fixation |
| Moderate     | Days         | Muscle density shifts, onset of kinetic signs, compulsive behaviors |
| High         | Immediate    | Full infusion, acute kinetic discharge, identity destabilization |
| Chronic      | Lifelong     | Persistent Tyrium signature, social contagion, irreversible psychological fixation |

---

## Containment Protocols (Revised)
**Extraction & Transport:** Triple-gasket transport crates with vibration isolation pods, with liquid Tyrium moved in cryo-stabilized ampoules housed inside Faraday-lined casings.

**Field PPE:** Two-layer suits with solvent-lined inner membranes for liquid exposures, paired with powered respirators featuring Tyrium-specific HEPA and catalytic scrubbers for vapor. Exposure limit: 30 minutes for crystalline or refined material and 10 minutes for airborne or liquid proximity operations, revised based on incident calibration.

**Decon:** Immediate neutralization agents for liquid contact (see Appendix — Solvent Formulae). Do not attempt surgical excision on recently infused tissue without Aurora-approved dampener implants.

**Quarantine & Psychological Intervention:** Any subject with patterned luminescence enters Level-3 Quarantine. Conduct psychological screening for fixation and compulsion, and initiate early cognitive-dampening protocols when indicated.

**Use-of-Force:** Infused organisms are considered both high-value subjects and high-risk vectors. **Do not** terminate without Aurora authorization; destructive measures are a last resort to prevent contagion spread.

---

## Field Notes & Best Practices
**Detect the glow early.** Luminescent striping is often visible before behavioral change.

**Liquid is the great equalizer.** It dramatically reduces the time-to-infusion and enables patterned uptake; treat any liquid Tyrium pool as an immediate epidemic vector.

**Kinetics predict behavior.** Cryo-dominant hosts tend to withdraw and defend, while pyro or electro hosts escalate confrontation, so plan containment accordingly.

**Maw-signatures may be transmissible at low bandwidth.** Audible reports of "call-and-return" vocalizations from Maw-linked hosts have been recorded; assume potential group synchronization risk.

## Appendix C — Incident Log Excerpts (Select)
**IL-17A:** Mining collapse, Kearsarge IV. Vein breached; vaporization event. Twelve personnel exposed; eight displayed patterned luminescence in 36 hours and two developed strong cryo manifestations. Quarantine enacted; subject T1 later assimilated into a Maw-affiliated group.

**IL-21F:** Illegal lab seizure. Several vials of liquid Tyrium bound with adulterants triggered rapid group contagion; decontamination required a solvent and dampener combination. Evidence indicated deliberate infusion protocols.

---

## Final Notes (Operational & Ethical)
Tyrium offers tactical advantage but carries existential risk. It does not merely empower — it rewrites the priority structures of organisms and groups. Aurora research continues to explore dampening, safe channeling, and ethical frameworks, but caution is mandatory: when things start to glow, the right answer is rarely to take more.

**Directive:** Report all non-lab Tyrium encounters immediately. Do not attempt unsanctioned stabilization or sale. Tyrium corrupts markets as well as minds.
