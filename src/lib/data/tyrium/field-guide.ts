## Overview
Tyrium is a family of anomalous states arising from a single exotic substrate recovered from deep planetary strata. It behaves simultaneously as mineral, energetic field, and a bio-corruptive vector. Tyrium interacts with entropy and informational gradients, producing ordered micro-regions that biological and mechanical systems can channel — at a cost. Manifestations are context-dependent: environment, method of extraction, and host biology produce distinct forms and effects.

## Summary of Forms (at-a-glance)
- **Raw Vein Tyrium** — in-situ crystalline ore. Stable in rock; hazardous when mined.  
- **Refined Tyrium** — processed fragments/friction-polished shards used in Aurora tech. Volatile.  
- **Liquid Tyrium** — a viscous, luminescent fluid phase; chemically and psychically active. *(NEW)*  
- **Vaporized Tyrium** — aerosolized, highly bioavailable; the most infectious non-contact state.  
- **Infused Tyrium (Biological State)** — Tyrium integrated into living tissue, forming conduits and signatures.

---

## 1. Raw Vein Tyrium
- **Appearance:** Jagged lattice, blue-white luminescence; faint harmonic drift visible under spectroscopy.  
- **Behavior:** Emits low-frequency resonance when mechanically stressed.  
- **Stability & Handling:** Usually safe while embedded; destabilizes when sonically or thermally shocked. Standard mining protocols apply (see Containment).  
- **Field Note:** Vein geometry often predicts local "cold spots" and fauna anomalies.

---

## 2. Refined Tyrium
- **Appearance:** Clear, faceted fragments; can be cut into lenses, rods, or pellets.  
- **Behavior:** Concentrated resonance; amplifies electromagnetic coupling and can be used as compact energy stores in Aurora devices.  
- **Hazards:** Short exposures cause sensory distortion and mild autonomic collapse in unprotected subjects.  
- **Application:** Experimental field batteries and conduit cores.

---

## 3. Liquid Tyrium
- **Appearance:** Viscous fluid, color range from deep sapphire to milky opal depending on impurity load. Surface emits slow, concentric ripples of light.  
- **Generation:** Observed where refined Tyrium undergoes rapid pressure/temperature volatility (reactor breaches, high-energy milling) or when vein ore is melted under exotic catalysts. Also produced intentionally in clandestine labs for infusion protocols.  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Forms menisci that resist typical surface tension models; droplets can roll uphill on ferromagnetic surfaces when under resonance.  
  - Interfaces strongly with aqueous and lipid tissues, increasing uptake efficiency for biological infusion.  
  - Evaporative profile produces the same vapor species as Vaporized Tyrium but at a controllable rate.  
- **Biological Effect:** Liquid phase penetrates exposed dermis and mucosa rapidly, seeding infusion patterns that map to vascular and nervous structures. On contact, a "bloom" of bio-illumination often appears within hours.  
- **Containment:** Requires both chemical neutralizers (see Appendix — Tyrium Solvents) and field dampeners. Liquid pools generate local psychotropic halos and are major vectors for group contagion — extreme quarantine.  
- **Field Use / Abuse:** Weaponized as a dispersal medium (clandestine dosing), or used in surgical "bonding" procedures by fringe groups seeking predictable infusion patterns.  
- **Note:** Liquid Tyrium can be stabilized into gels for transport but such gels can re-liquefy under electromagnetic excitation.

## 4. Vaporized Tyrium
- **Appearance:** Thin, shimmering azure mist; invisible on IR but detectable on subsonic scanners.  
- **Behavior:** Most efficient non-contact pathway for biological resonance seeding. Aerosols strongly bind to cationic proteins in lung tissue.  
- **Hazards:** Rapid onset of metabolic alteration; inhalation exposure is escalation pathway to infusion in under 48 hours.

---

## 5. Infused Tyrium (Biological State)
- **Appearance:** Patterned bioluminescence—stripes, veins, or sigils—along integument, often following neural/vascular maps.  
- **Functional Effect:** Host becomes a resonant conduit capable of channeling Tyrium’s order into directed manifestations (referred to as **kinetics**). Expression varies widely by host, infusion pattern, and origin of Tyrium exposure.
- **Psychological / Social Effect:** Escalating obsession, territorial fixation, and social contagion. Infused groups can form emergent hierarchies around "resource" sites.

## KINETICS — Types, Origins, and Expressions
*Important framing:* “Kinetics” refers to the host’s capacity to manipulate a physical parameter of their environment via Tyrium-mediated resonant coupling. Kinetics is **not** a single power; it is a family of possible manipulations whose form depends on origin, infusion topology, and host physiology.

### A. Origins & Correlations
- **Maw-Origin Tyrium**  
  - Historically associated with the Maw phenomenon and Maw-affected hosts.  
  - Most commonly yields **cryo-kinetic** manifestations (local suppression of particle motion, frost generation, solidification of moisture).  
  - Hosts often show patterned banding along limbs and torso and a strong compulsion to return to Tyrium sources.  
- **Colony/Industrial-Origin Tyrium**  
  - Tyrium processed or adulterated by industrial reagents, or implanted via Aurora tech, tends to produce **variant kinetics** — e.g., pyrolytic bursts, electromagnetic surges, or directed pressure fields.  
  - These manifestations are often less stable and more sensitive to damping fields.  
- **Aleatory/Natural Variation**  
  - Some low-level Tyrium occurrences (trace, mixed-mineral veins) have produced **gravitic modulation**, **telekinetic displacement**, or **psionic-affiliated** sensory enhancements. These are rare but documented.

### B. Common Kinetic Families
- **Cryo-Kinesis** — local entropy suppression; ice formation, reduced thermal agitation. (Maw-aligned hosts most associated.)  
- **Pyro-Kinesis** — focused exothermic bursts, ignition of combustibles, localized temperature spikes. (Often industrial/refined origin.)  
- **Electro-Kinesis** — generation and shaping of electrical fields; EMP-style disruption, directed arcs.  
- **Gravitic/Pressure Kinesis** — modulation of local force vectors; pushing/pulling objects, micro-gravity wells.  
- **Telekinetic/Vector Kinesis** — direct manipulation of macroscopic objects without clear intermediary fields; manifests as precise, often surgical force application.  
- **Psionic-Affine Sensory Kinesis** — enhanced perceptual acuity, low-bandwidth empathic resonance, and in some cases, rudimentary group-synchronization.  
- **Hybrid Expressions** — many hosts display composites (e.g., cryo + pressure) depending on infusion topology.

### C. Expression Patterns
- **Conduit Topology Matters.** Stripes along muscle groups favor force/strength amplification. Branching patterns along neural maps favor perceptual or motor-precision kinetics. Dense focal nodules produce high-energy bursts but at great physiological cost.  
- **Dose and Distribution.** Sparse, distributed infusion tends to yield subtle, controllable kinetics. Heavy, focal infusion yields raw power and rapid psychological corruption.  
- **Behavioral Triggers.** Emotional arousal (fear, rage, lust) acts as an amplifier. Stress or pain often unlocks latent kinetic outputs.

### D. Examples (Case Briefs)
- **Subject Tundra (Maw-Influenced)** — Primary expression: cryo-kinetics with muscular hypertrophy. Clear stripe-pattern infusion across flanks correlates with limb-focused channeling and frost-aura. Behavioral profile: defensive, isolative, periodically violent under provocation.  
- **Subject Corval (Industrial Infusion)** — Exhibits mixed kinetic output: brief electromagnetic pulses followed by focused telekinetic micro-manipulation. Infusion pattern: nodal implants along cervical spine. Behavioral profile: obsessive, strategic, seeks to "free" Maw-affected subjects.

## Interactions (Expanded)
- **Environmental:** Tyrium subsets alter local fluid dynamics, sound propagation, and electromagnetic baseline. Liquid pools create standing wave patterns that attract small fauna.  
- **Biological:** Binds to genomic regulatory motifs; can rewrite protein expression related to muscle, nerve conduction, and hormone regulation. Liquid and vapor phases accelerate this process.  
- **Mechanical:** Causes unpredictable resonance with machine parts — bearings seize, capacitors collapse, sensors return false positives. Refined Tyrium used as energy conduit can catastrophically amplify transient inputs.  
- **Social/Psychic:** Group exposure fosters synchronized fixation; in extreme cases, hosts coordinate to guard Tyrium sources as if under shared compulsion.

## Effects by Exposure Level (Updated)
| **Exposure** | **Duration** | **Observed Effect** |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Trace dust   | Minutes      | Mild vertigo, tingling; short-term sensory sharpening |
| Low vapor    | Hours        | Dermal luminescence, chills, minor compulsions |
| Liquid touch | Minutes–Hours| Rapid dermal uptake; localized infusion patterning; euphoria → fixation |
| Moderate     | Days         | Muscle density shifts, onset of kinetic signs, compulsive behaviors |
| High         | Immediate    | Full infusion, acute kinetic discharge, identity destabilization |
| Chronic      | Lifelong     | Persistent Tyrium signature, social contagion, irreversible psychological fixation |

## Containment Protocols (Revised)
1. **Extraction & Transport:** Triple-gasket transport crates; vibration isolation pods. Liquid Tyrium transported in cryo-stabilized ampoules within Faraday-lined casings.  
2. **Field PPE:** Two-layer suits with solvent-lined inner membrane for liquid exposures; powered respirators with Tyrium-specific HEPA + catalytic scrubbers for vapor. Exposure limit: 30 minutes for crystalline/refined, 10 minutes for airborne/liquid proximity operations, revised based on incident calibration.  
3. **Decon:** Immediate neutralization agents for liquid contact (see Appendix — Solvent Formulae). Do not attempt surgical excision on recently-infused tissue without Aurora-approved dampener implants.  
4. **Quarantine & Psychological Intervention:** Any subject with patterned luminescence enters Level-3 Quarantine. Psychological screening for fixation and compulsion; early cognitive-dampening protocols recommended.  
5. **Use-of-Force:** Infused organisms are considered both high-value subjects and high-risk vectors. **Do not** terminate without Aurora authorization; destructive measures are last resort to prevent contagion spread.

## Field Notes & Best Practices
- **Detect the glow early.** Luminescent striping is often visible before behavioral change.  
- **Liquid is the great equalizer.** It dramatically reduces the time-to-infusion and enables patterned uptake; treat any liquid Tyrium pool as an immediate epidemic vector.  
- **Kinetics predict behavior.** Cryo-dominant hosts tend to withdraw and defend; pyro/electro hosts escalate confrontation. Plan containment accordingly.  
- **Maw-signatures may be transmissible at low bandwidth.** Audible reports of "call-and-return" vocalizations from Maw-linked hosts have been recorded; assume potential group synchronization risk.

- **IL-21F:** Illegal lab seizure. Several vials of liquid Tyrium bound with adulterants. Rapid group contagion; decontamination required solvent + dampener combo. Evidence of deliberate infusion protocols.

## Final Notes (Operational & Ethical)
Tyrium offers tactical advantage but carries existential risk. It does not merely empower — it rewrites the priority structures of organisms and groups. Aurora research continues to explore dampening, safe channeling, and ethical frameworks, but caution is mandatory: when things start to glow, the right answer is rarely to take more.

**Directive:** Report all non-lab Tyrium encounters immediately. Do not attempt unsanctioned stabilization or sale. Tyrium corrupts markets as well as minds.
