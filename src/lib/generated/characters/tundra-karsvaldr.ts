          "Tundra Karsvaldr was born in Draumveil Crater Colony, the place miners call The Maw. His father dragged the family there from an agrarian outpost on Kearsarge IV. He wanted to prove himself in the veins, to win something more than dirt and wheat. The governor's office logged their arrival like it logs all arrivals: another family for the machine.",
          "The Maw had no patience for pride. His father died young, marrow collapse before Tundra learned to read. I've seen dozens of such men--bodies emptied, spines bowed, eyes gone gray. But I wonder if the boy remembers his father at all, or if he remembers only absence.",
          "His mother, Elin, lived on. Stronger than she let on. I've reviewed enough witness notes to know she was likely Cat-4, but she hid it. Avoided testing, kept to low-risk duties. People whispered, but whispers die in the Maw faster than men do. She carried the boy as best she could, quiet and steady, as if refusing to be noticed could shield him from the same fate."

          "But Tundra thrived. I've read the records a dozen times. He worked shifts that broke older men. Hauled double loads, lungs clear in vapor that sent others to their knees. His coat--pale, faintly blue under Tyrium lamps--earned him the first name the miners gave him: White Maw. At first a joke, then something heavier. A mark.",
          "Even then, there was something uncanny. Vapor bending around him, dust clearing as though the air itself bent to his frame. Miners avoid the strange--they mock it, then they fear it. With him, fear took root quickly.",
          "I tell myself I study these things professionally. That's why I pore over the early notes. But when I picture him at sixteen--already broadening, already different from the others--I find myself lingering too long. My pen drags. I shouldn't."

Crews followed him into the shafts, convinced his shadow protected them. Others fled his presence, muttering that he \"stole their air.\"",

I use that word in my own notes, here, where no one will read it. His movements were clean, unhurried. He carried loads that should have left him staggering, and yet he moved with grace.",

Seyfert believes they own him, that they can cage him and catalog his power, breed him like stock. They don't see it. They don't feel it.",

When he moves through the caverns, the air sharpens; tools crack with ice, and yet he burns with impossible vitality.\n\n**Private note:** I met him once in the caverns, against protocol.

Recovered each time without resistance, returned to shaft rotation as if nothing occurred.\n\n**Behavioral Note:**\nSpeaks of the Core as if it summons him.

I tell myself I go for study, for insight, but the lie grows thinner each time.\n\nWhen he draws me close, I feel the Tyrium moving in him, and then—impossibly—through me.

And afterward comes the horror, knowing it is not leaving me.\n\nI hide it as best I can, but I see it: faint streaks of cobalt in my own fur, glowing when the cavern darkens, shimmering just like his.

The Maw’s beast, Seyfert’s blade.\n\nBut I remember what he was in the caverns, when the vapor flowed through us both. I can still feel it, even now. It burns under my skin, traces of cobalt showing in my own fur. I bind them, cover them, but they spread. The Maw is in me. He put it there.\n\nWhen I see him through the glass, he is no longer the sovereign the Rift crowned. They have shackled his will, broken the terrible majesty that made men vanish and others kneel. He obeys. He answers. He does not look at me as he once did.\n\nStill—I will not leave him to them. I will free him, tear down the walls, return him to the Maw. Back to what he is meant to be. Back to what we are meant to be.\n\nBut a fear gnaws at me. What if he does not follow? What if he will not come? I tell myself the Maw’s will is inevitable, that he is mine, but when I close my eyes I see him looking past me, beyond me, back toward the Rift. And in that gaze, I know: if I bring him out, it will not be for me.\n\nStill—I will do it. I have no choice. He is inevitable. And if he will not be mine, then at least he will be the Maw’s again.\n\n> *Margin (smudged, half-erased):* “I love him. Or I love what the Maw made of him. Perhaps there is no difference.”"

His father dragged the family there from an agrarian outpost on Kearsarge IV. He wanted to prove himself in the veins, to win something more than dirt and wheat. The governor's office logged their arrival like it logs all arrivals: another family for the machine.\n\nThe Maw had no patience for pride. His father died young, marrow collapse before Tundra learned to read. I've seen dozens of such men--bodies emptied, spines bowed, eyes gone gray. But I wonder if the boy remembers his father at all, or if he remembers only absence.\n\nHis mother, Elin, lived on. Stronger than she let on. I've reviewed enough witness notes to know she was likely Cat-4, but she hid it. Avoided testing, kept to low-risk duties. People whispered, but whispers die in the Maw faster than men do. She carried the boy as best she could, quiet and steady, as if refusing to be noticed could shield him from the same fate."

Hauled double loads, lungs clear in vapor that sent others to their knees. His coat--pale, faintly blue under Tyrium lamps--earned him the first name the miners gave him: White Maw. At first a joke, then something heavier. A mark.\n\nEven then, there was something uncanny. Vapor bending around him, dust clearing as though the air itself bent to his frame. Miners avoid the strange--they mock it, then they fear it. With him, fear took root quickly.\n\nI tell myself I study these things professionally. That's why I pore over the early notes.

White Maw.\n\nViklund's reports from the Rift show the truth of it: Tundra worked longer, carried more, grew larger each week. Tools bent in his hands. Frost feathered steel where he braced. Crews followed him into the shafts, convinced his shadow protected them. Others fled his presence, muttering that he \"stole their air.\"\n\nI was assigned his handler then. Officially, I was to catalog rumors, keep a human ledger of what the data couldn't show. Unofficially--I began to watch him. And watching became something else.\n\nHe was taller than the Cat-4s, broader through the shoulders. Their strength looked swollen, unbalanced. His looked... natural. Beautiful. I use that word in my own notes, here, where no one will read it. His movements were clean, unhurried. He carried loads that should have left him staggering, and yet he moved with grace.\n\nI began writing lines I deleted from the official files. \"Not monstrous--perfected.\" \"Balanced.

The air shifted when he walked past, cold against my skin. My pulse quickened every time. I told myself it was fear. It wasn't. I dreamed of him. I dreamed of his strength close, of the frost on my lips, of his body against mine. And I woke ashamed, and wanting.\n\nWhen Myrren wrote her intake report, I read it in secret. Her words trembled with the same distraction. She pretended it was scientific awe, but I recognized myself in her lines. Seyfert believes they own him, that they can cage him and catalog his power, breed him like stock. They don't see it. They don't feel it.\n\nHe isn't theirs. He never was.
